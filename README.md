### Adding Colors (Optional)

GitHub Markdown doesn’t natively support colors, but you can use inline HTML/CSS for limited styling. For example:

```html
<h3 style="color: green;">🎉 Success!</h3>
<p style="color: red;">⚠️ Error: Invalid input.</p>
```

This will render as:

<h3 style="color: green;">🎉 Success!</h3>
<p style="color: red;">⚠️ Error: Invalid input.</p>

Use this sparingly to highlight important sections.
